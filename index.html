                <h3><a href="https://chipotle.com/" class="red">Chipotle</a></h3>
                <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://drpma142ptgxf.cloudfront.net/assets/logo.svg"/></p>
                <p>Location: 212 S Grand Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63103</p>
                <p>What I Order: Sofritas Burrito with white rice, black and pinto beans, fajita veggies, pico, hot and corn salsa, cheese, and sour cream</p>
                <p>Ballpark Cost: $10</p>
                <p>Why I Love It: I used to be a Qdoba girl, but the first time I tried Chipotle I knew that my allegiance had shifted. Chipotle gives you a sh*t-ton of food at a very reasonable price and leaves you full for hours and hours. The location on Grand is particularly tasty as they pile in the fillings, the salsa is always spicy, and they have some professional-grade burrito-wrappers on their team.</p>
                <p class="fancy">Best For: an after-workout binge fest</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.stlsouthern.com/" class="black">Southern</a></h3>
                <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/41e341_6ae22b8e56fd4a68bb613359e579ea53~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_600,h_278,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/41e341_6ae22b8e56fd4a68bb613359e579ea53~mv2.png"/></p>
                <p>Location: 3108 Olive St, St. Louis, MO 63103</p>
                <p>What I Order: Fried Green Tomatoes, Firebird (mild) with mashed potatoes, and Banana Pudding</p>
                <p>Ballpark Cost: $20</p>
                <p>Why I Love It: This place is always poppin' but the line moves quickly and I've never had a problem getting a seat. The Fried Green Tomatoes are salty and juicy, almost like a tomato-version of a deep-fried pickle, while the mashed potatoes are ALWAYS on point. If you're lucky enough to go there when they have Banana Pudding, I definitely recommend this sweet, cool deliciousness as a way to cool off your mouth after all that hot chicken.</p>
                <p class="fancy">Best For: a realaxed, small family get-together</p>

                <div><h3><a href="http://kingandistl.com/" id="king">King and I</a></h3></div>
                <p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51f0aa26e4b027aa808b4973/t/51f0b22ae4b09e9d4f5209b8/1487720621131/?format=750w"/></p>
                <p>Location: 3155 S Grand Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63118</p>
                <p>What I Order: Papaya Salad and Red Curry (medium) with tofu</p>
                <p>Ballpark Cost: $20</p>
                <p>Why I Love It: There is a requirement when one visits the King and I—YOU MUST GET THE PAPAYA SALAD. I don't even like papaya and I looooove the Papaya Salad. It's super fresh and addictingly spicy with a perfectly crunchy texture. Additionally, it's a perfect complement to any curry dish as you get to experience the best of both worlds in one meal: crunchy-fresh and creamy-stew. They also have a small gated patio on the side which is great for dog-watching on a warm spring night.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://eatcalzones.com/" class="black">Sauce on the Side</a></h3>
                <p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://eatcalzones.com/Images/Sauce-on-the-Side_Oval-for-menu-page.png"/></p>
                <p>Location: 411 N 8th St, St. Louis, MO 63101</p>
                <p>What I Order: Pancho Villa with corn salsa and plum tomatoes and Nutella Banana</p>
                <p>Ballpark Cost: $20</p>
                <p>Why I Love It: Big 'zones baked to order and even delivered—need I say more? I will regardless. If a lake of warm nutella sounds like something you want to dive into face-first, I highly recommend the Nutella Banana dessert calzone. For how delicious it is at only six bucks, this is a STEAL.</p>
                <p class="fancy">Best For: an evening show marathon with a group of friends</p>

                <h3><a href="http://smashburger.com/" class="red">Smashburger</a></h3>
                <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://www.choctawcasinos.com/media/1354/smashburger_jpg1340x450_default.jpg"/></p>
                <p>Location: 1671 Clarkson Rd, Chesterfield, MO 63017</p>
                <p>What I Order: Spicy Jalapen&#771;o Baja Burger with Spicy Buffalo Fries and a Strawberry Shake</p>
                <p>Ballpark Cost: $15</p>
                <p>Why I Love It: This restaraunt gets your food out to you CRAZY FAST, at least they do at the Chesterfield location. The food is always fresh and super tasty with the best black bean patty I've ever had.</p>
                <p class="fancy">Best For: a quick bite that still feels like you spent a sufficient amount of time with the people you went with (lunch with your boo's parents, anyone?)</p>
